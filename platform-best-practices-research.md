# Modern Platform Best Practices Research Report
## For Dominican Republic Expropriation Management System

Based on analysis of the PRD document and research into current best practices for building modern platforms, this report provides comprehensive guidance for addressing the common business issues identified in the expropriation workflow process.

## Executive Summary

The current expropriation process involves 16 sequential steps across multiple departments with significant challenges:
- **Duplicity of functions** between departments
- **Lack of real-time tracking** of file status
- **Excessive paper dependency** and manual processes
- **Sequential bottlenecks** that could be parallelized

This research synthesizes best practices from authoritative sources to build a modern digital platform that addresses these issues through technology.

## 1. Platform Architecture Patterns

### Recommendation: **Modular Monolith with Microservices Readiness**

**Why not pure Microservices:**
- Based on microservices.io research: "Use microservices for rapid, frequent delivery in volatile markets"
- Government processes are typically more stable with clear regulatory boundaries
- Initial complexity overhead outweighs benefits for predictable workflows

**Why not pure Monolith:**
- Traditional monoliths lack the modularity needed for independent department updates
- Difficult to scale individual components based on departmental load

**Recommended Pattern: Modular Monolith**
- **Domain-driven design** with clear bounded contexts for each department
- **Internal module boundaries** that can be extracted to microservices later
- **Shared kernel** for common government services (authentication, notifications)
- **Event-driven communication** between modules for loose coupling

**Architecture Layers:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Presentation Layer (Web/Mobile/API)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Application Service Layer               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Domain Modules (Avalúos, Jurídico, etc) │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Infrastructure Layer (Database, Cache)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 3. Database Design Patterns for Platform Data

### Polyglot Persistence Strategy
**Multiple databases for different data types:**

1. **PostgreSQL (Primary Database)**
   - Structured data: Users, departments, workflow status
   - Financial data: Payment records, budget allocations
   - ACID compliance for financial transactions
   - JSONB fields for flexible document metadata

2. **MongoDB (Document Database)**
   - Document metadata and versioning
   - Audit logs and change history
   - Flexible schema for varying document types
   - Full-text search capabilities

3. **Elasticsearch (Search Engine)**
   - Full-text document search
   - Advanced filtering and faceting
   - Real-time search across all documents

### Data Design Patterns

**Event Sourcing for Workflow Tracking**
- All workflow changes stored as immutable events
- Complete audit trail for compliance requirements
- Ability to reconstruct file state at any point in time

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
- Separate read and write models for optimal performance
- Optimized queries for dashboard and reporting
- Simplified complex business logic in command handlers

**Database Schema Example:**
```sql
-- Core entities
CREATE TABLE expedientes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    numero_expediente VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    estado_actual VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    creado_en TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    actualizado_en TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE departamentos (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    nombre VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    codigo VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

-- Workflow tracking
CREATE TABLE workflow_transiciones (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    expediente_id UUID REFERENCES expedientes(id),
    desde_departamento_id UUID REFERENCES departamentos(id),
    hacia_departamento_id UUID REFERENCES departamentos(id),
    usuario_id UUID NOT NULL,
    fecha_transicion TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    comentarios TEXT
);
```

## 4. API Design and Integration Best Practices

### RESTful API Design
**Resource Modeling:**
```
GET    /api/v1/expedientes              # List files with filtering
POST   /api/v1/expedientes              # Create new file
GET    /api/v1/expedientes/{id}         # Get specific file
PUT    /api/v1/expedientes/{id}         # Update file
DELETE /api/v1/expedientes/{id}         # Delete file (soft delete)

GET    /api/v1/expedientes/{id}/documentos     # Get file documents
POST   /api/v1/expedientes/{id}/documentos     # Upload document
GET    /api/v1/expedientes/{id}/workflow       # Get workflow history
POST   /api/v1/expedientes/{id}/transiciones   # Move to next department

GET    /api/v1/departamentos             # List departments
GET    /api/v1/departamentos/{id}/tareas # Get department tasks
```

### API Best Practices

## 5. Security and Authentication Patterns

### Zero Trust Security Model
**Never trust, always verify:**
- Every request must be authenticated and authorized
- Network segmentation between departments
- Principle of least privilege for all system access

### Authentication & Authorization
**OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect:**
- **Centralized identity provider** for government employees
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** by department and function
- **Multi-factor authentication** for sensitive operations
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** across government systems

**Access Control Example:**
```javascript
// Department-based access control
const permissions = {
  'departamento-avaluos': ['read:expedientes', 'update:avaluos'],
  'departamento-juridico': ['read:expedientes', 'update:legal', 'approve:contracts'],
  'departamento-financiero': ['read:expedientes', 'approve:payments', 'process:checks']
};
```

### Data Security
**Encryption at Rest and in Transit:**
- **TLS 1.3** for all network communications
- **AES-256 encryption** for sensitive document storage
- **Field-level encryption** for personal identifiable information (PII)
- **Database encryption** using Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

### Compliance & Audit
**OWASP Top 10 Compliance:**
- **Input validation** to prevent injection attacks
- **Secure authentication** to prevent broken access control
- **Security logging** and monitoring for incident response
- **Regular security assessments** and penetration testing
